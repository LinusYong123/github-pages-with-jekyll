## Birthday!
Today was my birthday! For breakfast we had oreo ice cream cake, lunch we had dumplings and roast duck, and dinner we had Phil's Barbecue. It cost $79! I got a stuffed hand-made bunny from Justine, a maze from Atticus, cake from Zoey, Lego from Mama, books from Papa, and a sweater from KK Popo. ðŸŽŠ
